# CS3200 Final Project

## Austin Animal Shelter

### Goal: Provide a command line UI that allows you to access and modify the data of the Austin Animal Shelter.

### How to run this program:
 `git clone` the repository to your local machine

Navigate to the `sql` directory and open the file `Animal Shelter Data Dump.sql` file in MySQL Workbench or an equivalent IDE. Execute the dump so that all Animal Shelter data is added to your local database.

Run the following command, replacing JAR_PATH with the full path to the jarfile on your local machine. The jar file is located at /out/artifacts/AnimalShelter_jar/AnimalShelter.jar :

`java -jar JAR_PATH.jar`

For example, on my local machine, I would run the following command: 

`java -jar C:/Users/nicol/dev/cs3200/out/artifacts/AnimalShelter_jar/AnimalShelter.jar`
