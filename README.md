# CS3200 Final Project

## Austin Animal Shelter

### Goal: Provide a command line UI that allows you to access and modify the data of the Austin Animal Shelter.

### How to run this program:
#### `git clone` the repository to your local machine
#### Navigate to the sql directory and open the file `Database Data Dump.sql` file in MySQL Workbench or an equivalent IDE. Execute the dump so that all Animal Shelter data is added to your local database.
#### Run the following command, replacing JAR_PATH with the path to the jarfile on your local machine: 
`java -jar JAR_PATH.jar`
